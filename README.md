Automation of Renaming the Files

Consider the problem where you have a large number of files that YOU need to rename. It is boring work, so we can automate this with a Python script.
For example, we have 10 videos with these names. Considering that the ordering is based on the first letter, the first video that will be played is not in order. However, first, we need to watch the video with the number #1. So we need to rename all the videos.

After some shit code, we came to the result like this:
